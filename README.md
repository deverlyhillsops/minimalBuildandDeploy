Hi, I'm Marc. I've been a DevOps engineer for several years, but I haven't developed with C# since university (over 15 years ago!). I'm passionate about learning and want to get back into C# coding. I've decided to create a simple set of APIs using the latest minimal API approach. I'll then build and deploy the code to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Azure DevOps YAML pipelines.

Objectives
----------
- Refresh my C# programming skills
- Gain experience with the latest minimal APIs
- Gain experience with AKS and deploying to AKS

Plan
----
 - Create a simple set of APIs using minimal API:
    - Define endpoints and handle requests using the minimal API framework
    - Implement authentication and authorization to secure the APIs

Build and deploy the code to AKS:
---------------------------------
- Use Azure DevOps YAML pipelines to automate the build and deployment process
- Configure AKS to run the containerized application

Test and monitor the deployed application:
------------------------------------------
- Validate the functionality and performance of the deployed APIs
- Implement monitoring to ensure the health and stability of the application
